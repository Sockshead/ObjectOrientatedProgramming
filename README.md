# Object Orientated Programming
This is a specialisation course from The IT-University in Copenhagen.

Læringsmål:	After the course the student should be able to:
- explain the OOP concepts of encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism and apply them to solve problems in a single inheritance language like Java.
- devise and design software solutions to problems using OOP concepts and common design patterns.
- identify exceptional cases in relation to functional correctness and robustness of programs, and apply such mechanisms in Java to handle these cases-
- define and implement custom data structures, generic classes and collections in Java.
- design and Implement multi-threaded applications in Java.
- use I/O streams to develop programs that manipulate text and binary files.
- create simple graphical user interfaces using Java Swing.

Fagligt indhold:	
The course gives participants the skills necessary to design and develop medium-sized applications in Java. The course covers the key concepts of OOP exemplified in Java. Notably, it touches upon a selection of the following topics: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, exception handling, threads, containers, generics, I/O streams, event programming, and graphical user interfaces. Using the knowledge and skills gathered during the course, participants will be able to identify problems in programming, to think about their solution in a creative and comprehensive way, and to choose the proper approaches and techniques to address them.
