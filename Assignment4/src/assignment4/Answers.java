    Question 5:
    Case 1) "I am a PhD student"
    Case 2) "I am a PhD student"
    Case 3) "I am a TA"
    Case 4) "Error" - cannot compile because student is not a TA
    Case 5) "Error" - cannot compile because TA & PhD are not the same classes.
    
    Question 6:
    student = phd;              // line 1 
    student.display();          // line 2
    - Console: "I am a PhD student"
    
    student = (student) phd;    // line 1
    student.display();          // line 2
    - Console: "I am a regular student"
    
    Question 8:
